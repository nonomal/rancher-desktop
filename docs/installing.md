## Linux

### Requirements

Rancher Desktop requires the following on Linux:

- A distribution that can install .deb or .rpm packages, or AppImages.
- A persistent internet connection.

It is also recommended to have:

- 8 GB of memory
- 4 CPU

Additional resources may be required depending on the workloads you plan to run.

### Installation via .deb Package

Add the Rancher Desktop repository and install Rancher Desktop with:

```
curl https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/Rancher:/stable/deb/Release.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/Rancher:/stable/deb/ ./'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rancher-desktop
```

### Uninstalling .deb Package

You can remove the package, repository, and key with:

```
sudo apt remove --autoremove rancher-desktop
sudo add-apt-repository -r 'deb https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/Rancher:/stable/deb/ ./'
sudo apt-key del <keyid>
```

where `keyid` is the line above the one containing `isv:Rancher:stable`
when you run `apt-key list`. So if I have the following block for the
Rancher Desktop Key:

```
pub   rsa2048 2021-10-29 [SC] [expires: 2024-01-07]
      236E B3BE 8504 1EAE C40B  2641 2431 4E44 EE21 3962
uid           [ unknown] isv:Rancher:stable OBS Project <isv:Rancher:stable@build.opensuse.org>
```

then my `keyid` is `236E B3BE 8504 1EAE C40B  2641 2431 4E44 EE21 3962`.

### Installing via .rpm Package

Note: RHEL, Fedora, and related distributions package QEMU, which Rancher Desktop
uses on Linux, differently than other distributions. To use Rancher Desktop on these
distributions, please use the AppImage.

To add the repository and install on openSUSE:

```
sudo zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/Rancher:/stable/rpm/isv:Rancher:stable.repo
sudo zypper install rancher-desktop
```


### Uninstalling .rpm Package

Ensure that Rancher Desktop has exited (if not, it should appear in the dock) and do:

```
sudo zypper remove --clean-deps rancher-desktop
sudo zypper removerepo isv_Rancher_stable
```

### Installing via AppImage

You may download the AppImage [here].

In order to run it, simply make it executable and execute it.
For better integration with your desktop, you may use [AppImageLauncher].

[here]:
https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/Rancher:/stable/AppImage/rancher-desktop-latest-x86_64.AppImage
[AppImageLauncher]:
https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher

### Uninstalling AppImage

Simply delete the AppImage. That's it!
